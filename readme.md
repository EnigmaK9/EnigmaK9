## About Me

Hey there! 👋 I'm [Your Name], a passionate and results-driven Web Developer and Computer Engineer based in Mexico City, Mexico. With a strong background in web development, data science, and more, I'm dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the digital world.

## Experience 🌟

### Web Developer at Speed Pro

🕒 Jan. 2023 - Nov. 2023

🌐 [Speed Pro Website](https://www.speedpro.com/)

As a Web Developer at Speed Pro, I had the opportunity to revamp and optimize web applications using cutting-edge technologies. I harnessed the power of Firebase for seamless backend functionality, employed Bootstrap for creating responsive designs, and mastered HTML, CSS, and TypeScript for crafting elegant frontends. My skills in integrating databases led to improved data management, enhancing the overall user experience.

### Sentiment Analysis on X

🕒 Jul. 2023 - Expected end date: 2024

🏢 Digital Systems Lab, UNAM

In pursuit of my Computer Engineering degree, I am currently working on a sentiment analysis project for social media data. My journey involves implementing natural language processing techniques like tokenization, lemmatization, and stemming. Leveraging a multimodel database, I manage and analyze data using popular Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, NLTK, and Keras. SQL plays a pivotal role in data retrieval and model evaluation, where metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall are scrutinized.

### Volunteer at Virtual Teaching and Cyberpsychology Lab

🕒 Jan. 2023 - Jul. 2023

🏢 Virtual Teaching and Cyberpsychology Lab, UNAM

During my volunteer role, I was entrusted with securing servers and developing web applications. I utilized TypeScript and Python for web app development and integrated MariaDB databases to ensure secure data management. My proficiency in SQL, Python, and web development played a crucial role in supporting cyberpsychology research and teaching activities.

### Bootcamp: Master in Data Science

🕒 Mar. 2022 - Jun. 2023

🏢 Dev.F, México City, México

In the Data Science bootcamp, I honed my skills in SQL for working with databases like MongoDB and SQLite. I mastered Python and leveraged powerful libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis. MongoDB databases also came under scrutiny for data storage and retrieval. SQL played an essential role in efficiently managing relational data and integrating it into various data science workflows. I seamlessly applied statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms, often incorporating SQL for data preprocessing and analytical pipelines.
